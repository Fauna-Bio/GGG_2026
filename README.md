# *DEPower*: approximate power analysis with *DESeq2*

This repository accompanies a manuscript that describes how the *DESeq2* model can be solved, under conventional assumptions, to enable back-of-the-envelope samples size calculations for experiment design.

In `gg_260121_robichaud_demo`, we show the impact of these assumptions on the analysis of a thirteen-lined ground squirrel dataset and demonstrate that the approximation produces reasonable results consistent with a full analysis.

The calculator may be found at https://poweranalysis-fb.streamlit.app. The source code for the calculator is included in this repository; the Streamlit interface links to the repository https://github.com/gennadygorin/poweranalysis.
